# Linear Search
## Definition: 
A sequential search algorithm that checks each element in a list until the desired element is found or the list ends.\\

## Process:
- Start at the first element.
- Compare each element with the target.
- If a match is found, return the index.
- If no match is found by the end of the list, return -1.

## Time Complexity of Linear Search
- Best Case: O(1) - target is the first element.
- Average Case: O(n/2) - target is somewhere in the middle.
- Worst Case: O(n) - target is the last element or not present.
