### Asymptotic Notation & Recursion

#### Logarithmic Complexity
- **Definition**: The power to which a base needs to be raised to reach a given number is called the logarithm of that number for the respective base.
- **Logarithmic Complexity**: The running time grows logarithmically with the input size. Essentially, if you double the size of the input, the number of steps doesn't double but only increases by one.
  - **Example**: Binary Search
  - **Calculation**:
    \[
    \text{Total Frequency} = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + \left( (\log_2(n) + 1) + \log_2(n) + 1 + \log_2(n) + 1 + \log_2(n) + 1 \right) + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 10 + 4(\log_2(n) + 1) = 10 + 4\log_2(n) + 4 = 4\log_2(n)
    \]
    - **Complexity**: $O(\log_2(n))$

#### Polynomial Complexity
- **Definition**: An algorithm is considered polynomial time if the number of steps it takes to run is bounded by a polynomial function of input size \( n \). The increase in the running time is proportionate to the input size.
  - **Calculation**:
    \[
    \text{Total} = 1 + 1 + 1 + (n + 1) + n(n + 1) + n^2(n + 1) + n^3 + n^3 + n^2 + n + 1 + 1 = 3 + (n + 1) + n(n + 1) + n^2(n + 1) + 2n^3 + n^2 + n + 2 = 3n^3 + 3n^2 + 2n + 6
    \]
    - **Complexity**: $O(n^3)$

#### Exponential Complexity
- **Definition**: The running time grows exponentially with the input size. In simpler terms, an exponential time algorithm's runtime doubles with each additional input element. These algorithms are highly inefficient and become impractical for larger input sizes.

#### Recursion
- **Definition**: Recursive functions are functions that call themselves within their own definition. Recursion provides a way to break complicated problems down into simple problems which are easier to solve.
- **Conditions for Recursion**:
  - A base case identifying where the function should terminate.
  - A recursive case where a function calls itself.

##### Types of Recursion
1. **Direct Recursion**: A function directly calls itself within its own block of code.
2. **Indirect Recursion**: A function calls another function which then calls the first function again.
