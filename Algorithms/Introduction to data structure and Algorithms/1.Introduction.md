### Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis

#### What is a Data Structure?
- **Definition**: A data structure is a collection of data organized in some fashion.
- **Functionality**: It not only stores data but also supports operations for manipulating data in the structure.
  - **Example**: An array holds a collection of data in sequential order. Operations include finding the size of the array, storing, retrieving, and modifying data in the array.

#### Abstract Data Types (ADT)
- **Definition**: An abstract data type (ADT) is a model defined by:
  - A collection of data
  - A set of operations on that data
- **Specifications**:
  - Focus on what the ADT operations do, not on how to implement them.
- **Implementation**:
  - Involves choosing a particular data structure.

##### Key Concepts of ADT
- **Typical Operations**:
  - Adding data to a data collection
  - Removing data from a data collection
  - Asking questions about the data in a data collection
- **Difference from Data Structures**:
  - ADT represents the logical picture of the data and the operations to manipulate the data elements.
  - Data structure is the actual representation of the data during implementation and the algorithms used to manipulate the data elements.
  - ADT operates at the logical level, while the data structure operates at the implementation level.

#### Examples of ADT
- Class
- Linked List
- Queue
- Tree

### Analysis of Algorithms
**Efficiency of Algorithm Definition:**
The efficiency of an algorithm refers to the amount of computational resources used by the algorithm, such as time and memory, to solve a problem.

#### Efficiency Measure
- **Criteria**:
  - Time complexity: How long the program runs.
  - Space complexity: How much memory it uses.
- **Purpose**:
  - To decide which algorithm to implement before actually coding it.
  - To identify bottlenecks in the code without actual measurement.

#### Measuring Efficiency
- **Time Complexity**:
  - Function of the running time of the algorithm or program.
- **Space Complexity**:
  - Function of the memory space needed by the algorithm or program to run to completion.
- **General Rule**:
  - Higher complexity often indicates lower efficiency.

#### Approaches to Measuring Complexity
- **Empirical Approach**:
  - Implementing complete algorithms and executing them on a computer for various instances of the problem.
- **Theoretical (Apriori) Approach**:
  - Mathematically determining the resources such as time and space needed by the algorithm, as a function of a parameter related to the instances of the problem.

#### Importance of Algorithm Analysis
- **Correctness**:
  - Ensures the algorithm does what it is intended to do.
- **Performance**:
  - Evaluates the running time and storage consumption of the algorithm.
- **Comparison**:
  - Helps decide which correct algorithm to use based on efficiency.

#### Comparing Two Algorithms
- **Goal**:
  - To obtain a rough estimate independent of specific details like coding tricks, CPU speed, compiler optimizations, etc.
  - Focus on Big-O Analysis to ignore details and emphasize the general efficiency.

#### Apriori (Theoretical) Analysis
- **Focus**:
  - Frequency count of the statement: Number of times a statement is executed.
  - Time taken for a single execution of the statement.
- **Reason**:
  - Small input sizes often show negligible time differences due to external factors (OS, disk I/O, etc.).
  - Large input sizes are common in practice, and differences in efficiency become significant.

#### Examples of Code Segments
1. **Segment 1**:
   ```plaintext
   x = x + 2;
   ```
   - **Frequency Count**: 1

2. **Segment 2**:
   ```plaintext
   for (p <= 1 to n)
      x = x + 2
   end
   ```
   - **Frequency Count**: 3n + 1

3. **Segment 3**:
   ```plaintext
   for (q <= 1 to n)
      for (p <= 1 to n)
         x = x + 2
      end
   end
   ```
   - **Frequency Count**: 3nÂ² + 3n + 1
