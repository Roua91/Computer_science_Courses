# Merge Sort
### Definition:
Merge Sort is a stable, divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that divides the array into halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves to produce a fully sorted array.
\
### Process:
- Divide the array into two halves.
- Recursively sort each half.
- Merge the two sorted halves into one sorted array.\


### Stability Definition and Stability:
Stability: Merge Sort is stable because it maintains the relative order of equal elements during the merging process.\

### Time Complexity:
- Best Case: O(n log n)
- Average Case: O(n log n)
- Worst Case: O(n log n)
