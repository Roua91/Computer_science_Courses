|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Storage Mechanism**      | Contiguous block of memory; fixed-size array or dynamic circular array | Nodes with data and links to next node; dynamically allocated memory |
| **Access Time**            | Constant-time (O(1)) for front and rear access    | Constant-time (O(1)) for front and rear access     |
| **Insertion at End**       | Generally fast, O(1), unless resizing is needed  | O(1) insertion at the rear                          |
| **Deletion from Front**    | O(1) deletion                                    | O(1) deletion from the front                        |
| **Resizing**               | Costly; requires creating a new array and copying elements | Not needed; dynamic size                            |
| **Frequent Access**        | Less efficient, O(n), except for front/rear      | Less efficient, O(n), except for front/rear        |
| **Frequent Insertions/Deletions** | Efficient for rear insertions and front deletions (O(1)); resizing can be costly | Efficient for both front deletions and rear insertions (O(1)) |
| **Memory Usage**           | More efficient (no overhead for pointers); may have wasted space | Less efficient due to pointer overhead; no wasted space |
| **Use Cases**              | Fixed-size queues; scenarios with minimal resizing | Dynamically changing size; frequent enqueuing/dequeuing |
| **Advantages**             | Simple implementation; efficient for fixed-size or infrequently changing queues | Dynamic size; efficient for frequent insertions/deletions |
| **Disadvantages**          | Costly resizing; fixed maximum size unless resized | Pointer overhead; slightly more complex implementation |
