Letâ€™s break down **linear regression** step-by-step with its mathematical foundation:

---

### **Step 1: Define the Problem**

**Linear regression** aims to model the relationship between a **dependent variable** (target) and one or more **independent variables** (predictors) by fitting a linear equation to observed data.

For **simple linear regression** (one independent variable), the equation of the line is:
$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \epsilon\$
- $\(y\)$: Dependent variable (target or outcome)
- $\(x\)$: Independent variable (predictor or feature)
- $\(\beta_0\)$: Intercept (the value of \(y\) when \(x = 0\))
- $\(\beta_1\)$: Slope (rate of change of \(y\) with respect to \(x\))
- $\(\epsilon\)$: Error term (difference between observed and predicted values)

For **multiple linear regression** (multiple independent variables), the equation extends to:
$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + ... + \beta_n x_n + \epsilon\$

---

### **Step 2: Calculate the Predicted Values**

The model predicts \( \hat{y} \) (the estimate of \( y \)) for a given set of inputs \(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n\) using the formula:
$\hat{y} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + ... + \beta_n x_n\$
Our goal is to determine the values of the coefficients $(\(\beta_0, \beta_1, \dots, \beta_n\))$ that minimize the difference between the predicted values (\(\hat{y}\)) and the actual values (\(y\)).

---

### **Step 3: Error Term and Cost Function**

The difference between the actual and predicted values is called the **residual**:
\[
\text{Residual} = y - \hat{y}
\]
In linear regression, we want to minimize the **sum of squared residuals** or the **cost function**, which is commonly called the **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**:
\[
MSE = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2
\]
Where \(n\) is the number of data points.

The aim is to minimize this MSE by adjusting the coefficients \(\beta_0, \beta_1, \dots, \beta_n\).

---

### **Step 4: Solving for Coefficients (Ordinary Least Squares)**

The most common method for solving linear regression is **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)**. Using OLS, we find the coefficients that minimize the MSE.

#### For **simple linear regression**, the formulas for \(\beta_0\) and \(\beta_1\) are:
\[
\beta_1 = \frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2}
\]
Where:
- \(x_i\) and \(y_i\) are individual data points.
- \(\bar{x}\) and \(\bar{y}\) are the means of \(x\) and \(y\).

\[
\beta_0 = \bar{y} - \beta_1 \bar{x}
\]

#### For **multiple linear regression**, we use matrix algebra:
Let:
\[
\mathbf{X} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & x_{11} & x_{12} & \dots & x_{1n} \\
1 & x_{21} & x_{22} & \dots & x_{2n} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
1 & x_{m1} & x_{m2} & \dots & x_{mn}
\end{bmatrix}
, \quad
\mathbf{y} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
y_1 \\
y_2 \\
\vdots \\
y_m
\end{bmatrix}
\]
Where \(m\) is the number of observations, and \(n\) is the number of features (including a column of ones for the intercept term).

The **OLS solution** is derived as:
\[
\boldsymbol{\beta} = (\mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{X})^{-1} \mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{y}
\]
Where:
- \(\mathbf{X}^T\) is the transpose of the matrix \(\mathbf{X}\).
- \((\mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{X})^{-1}\) is the inverse of the product of \(\mathbf{X}^T\) and \(\mathbf{X}\).

This equation provides the values of \(\beta_0, \beta_1, \dots, \beta_n\).

---

### **Step 5: Assess the Model**

Once the coefficients are computed, the next step is to assess the quality of the model. Some common metrics include:

- **R-squared**: Measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables:
  \[
  R^2 = 1 - \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2}{\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \bar{y})^2}
  \]
  
- **Adjusted R-squared**: Adjusts \(R^2\) for the number of predictors in the model.

---

### **Step 6: Assumptions of Linear Regression**

Linear regression works best when these assumptions are met:

1. **Linearity**: The relationship between the independent and dependent variables is linear.
2. **Independence**: Observations are independent of each other.
3. **Homoscedasticity**: The variance of residuals is constant across all levels of the independent variables.
4. **Normality**: Residuals are normally distributed.

---

### **Step 7: Regularization (Advanced)**

To improve the model, especially when dealing with overfitting, you can use regularization techniques:

- **Ridge Regression**: Adds an \(L2\) penalty to the cost function to penalize large coefficients:
  
  $\text{Cost function} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2 + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^{p} \beta_j^2\$
  
- **Lasso Regression**: Adds an \(L1\) penalty, encouraging sparse models (many coefficients become zero):
  \$\text{Cost function} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2 + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^{p} |\beta_j|\$

---
