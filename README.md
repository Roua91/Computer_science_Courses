# Computer Science Courses Repository

This repository contains some of the courses I took during my Computer Science degree at university. 

## Course Overview

### [Algorithms](./Algorithms)
   - This course focuses on the design and analysis of algorithms, covering topics such as sorting, searching, graph algorithms, dynamic programming, and NP-completeness. 
   
### [Data Structures](./Data_Structure)
   - In this course, we studied various data structures including arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, heaps, hash tables, and graphs. 
   
### [Machine Learning](./Machine%20Learning)
   - This course introduced fundamental machine learning concepts including supervised and unsupervised learning, classification, regression, clustering.
   
### [Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)](./OOP)
   - This course taught the principles of object-oriented programming, focusing on encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. 
   
### [Parallel and Distributed Databases](./Parallel_Distributed_Databases)
   - This course covered the architecture and design principles of parallel and distributed database systems. Topics included query optimization, transaction processing, and the management of large-scale databases in distributed environments.
   
### [Statistical Programming](./Statistical%20Programming)
   - The course focused on using statistical methods and programming to analyze data. We used languages such as R to perform data analysis, visualization, and statistical modeling.
   
### [Summaries](./Summaries)
   - This folder contains concise summaries for different subjects:
     - **[Artificial Intelligence](./Summaries/Artificial_Intelligence)**: 
     - **[Operating System](./Summaries/Operating_System)**: 
     - **[Probability & Statistics](./Summaries/Probability&Statistics)**: 
     - **[Software Engineering](./Summaries/Software_Engineering)**: 


Each folder contains course notes and revision summaries. You can browse through the folders to find specific files related to the course or topic.
